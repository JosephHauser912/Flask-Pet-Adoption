# Flask Pet Adoption
Python, Flask, Dictionaries to create a pet adoption website!

Using a CodeCademy project, I used their resources and instruction to create a multi-page Flask website using the Python module Flask!


It was a fun afternoon activity, referencing animal details in a dictionary to populate individual pet pages.

First, I created hyperlinks to the pets listed in the "helper.py" file
